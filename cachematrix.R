## cachematrix.R
## Nathan Moser (nate@rezonate.org)
##
## Implements an object that calculates the inverse of a supplied matrix, 
## and caches the result in the object. If the object is used again with the 
## same input matrix, the cached result will be returned, rather than the
## inverse being calculated again.


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
